        EMBPROTOfact that you are here shows that you are curious to know about our
        story and I, being one of the 4 founders of <strong>EMBPROTO</strong>,
        believe that I am the right person to tell you.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The obvious question is <strong>What is EMBPROTO?</strong> But an even more
        important question is <strong>why does EMBPROTO exist?</strong> Why did we
        start this company?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        To answer that, we will have to go back to 2010. We, the 4 founders,
        graduated from engineering & had good offers from different companies.
        We started our careers with decent packages and everything seemed to be
        going well. But soon we realized that something was missing. Money was
        not the issue — <strong>Satisfaction</strong> was. It just didn’t feel
        right! We were so confused back then. We spent hours on the phone and
        made many trips to meet each other to decide on what to do.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Finally, after a year, we quit our respective jobs. It was not easy to
        convince ourselves, and even harder to convince our parents! And it was
        not their fault — we didn’t have any plans whatsoever. After leaving our
        jobs, the only plan was to meet at a friend’s place and think about what
        business we can do. Sounds crazy, right? Even I think it was a crazy
        idea.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        And that’s where our struggles began. We somehow decided to make a
        Chapati making machine — without any expertise, market study, or
        timeline. We struggled for 2 long years and finally arrived at a dead
        end. No more money, no more hope, and pressure from all sides… <br />
        <strong>We failed.</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We decided to shut down our machine-making business. But fortunately,
        our dreams of doing business were still alive. We gave ourselves 6
        months to figure out what to do next and took up all kinds of work:
        sourcing, trading, manufacturing, designing — literally anything to
        sustain ourselves.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        During this time, we met many students, individuals, and organizations
        who needed electronic hardware. These were not easily available in India
        and were expensive to source. It struck us that we had faced the same
        challenge during our Chapati Machine journey.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>That was our Eureka Moment.</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        With a little planning and some hard-earned money,{" "}
        <strong>EMBPROTO.IN was born in 2020</strong> as an e-commerce platform for
        all kinds of electronic hardware, components, robotic, mechanical, and
        DIY products.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        But getting EMBPROTO to where it is today wasn’t a cakewalk. Those 2 years
        of failure and struggle helped shape the journey from a 4-man team to
        what we are today.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Today, India is moving forward rapidly. Innovation is thriving, and
        makers and innovators are leading the way. <strong>EMBPROTO exists</strong>{" "}
        to support and accelerate this revolution and play our part in pushing
        India ahead.
